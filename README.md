# My Personal Project: Workout Tracker

## Introduction

The application will track workouts, including entries of exercises and information such as:
- weight
- sets
- reps
- rest time

It will show the *details* of a workout as well as a *history* of past workouts, 
so that users would be able to note their progress over time. 
This application would be helpful for gym rookies, seasoned fitness enthusiasts, or anyone who enjoys working out.

As someone who currently likes to keep a log of all my workouts in a spreadsheet, 
I wanted to track them in a format that is **accessible, well-organized, and simple to use**.
I hope to create an application that can allow me to easily add my workouts and see my progress.
